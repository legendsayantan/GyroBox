# GyroBox
I was always bothered by some android apps not having sensor-based gestures and controls , although they could do it easily and if they did , that would be pretty convenient to use. So this is my silly attempt to implement that feature by using external app. Refer to https://github.com/legendsayantan/GyroBox/blob/main/README.md for more details...
